# address_book_in_c

TASK:
Address book
In this task you will need to create a simple address book using single linked list. You will need to use C programming language. 

Address book should save this information:

Name
Surname
Email
Phone number
Your program should have this functionality:

Display all records in the address book
Add new address to the book (to the end)
Add new address indicating the position where to put it
Delete address indicating its position in the book
Delete whole address book
Find address by position
Find address by name, surname, email or phone number
All the addresses must be entered by the user.

By default, address book must have at least 10 addresses which should be loaded from a .csv file. File must go by the name addresses.csv. The program should look for this file of that user's home directory who started the program. The program should continue its work if the file doesn't exist. 

All linked list code part must be stored in a separate .c file.

All of your code must be stored in a github repository. Also, you can use other git services provider.
